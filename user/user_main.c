 * FunctionName : user_rf_cal_sector_set
 * Description  : SDK just reversed 4 sectors, used for rf init data and paramters.
 *                We add this function to force users to set rf cal sector, since
 *                we don't know which sector is free in user's application.
 *                sector map for last several sectors : ABCCC
 *                A : rf cal
 *                B : rf init data
 *                C : sdk parameters
 * Parameters   : none
 * Returns      : rf cal sector
